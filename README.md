# *Cracking the Coding Interview* Solutions

My solutions to exercises in the book *Cracking the Coding Interview*.

There are a some errors in the solutions in the book. You can search for **ERROR** to find the ones I spotted.

**Most solutions include:**

- A function that does the task in a more low level way.
- A function that does the task an easier way, using relevant libraries.
- Possibly some other interesting implementations.
- Unit testing.
